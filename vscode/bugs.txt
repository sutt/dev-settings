- unresolved import is highlighted as a problem:
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53939751/pylint-unresolved-import-error-in-visual-studio-code

		
		OptionA:
		I was getting this problem because I was opening VScode in my project's root dir, but the main code was in a nested SRC dir. VSCode won't look for modules there by default. I fixed the import-resolve issues in VSCode by setting the env variable PYTHONPATH to include the path to SRC in my local .env file, and I got VSCode to recognize that setting by including "python.envFile": "${workspaceRoot}/.env" in my .vscode/settings.json file. This was a useful read.
		
		OptionB:
		In the meantime, I silenced these messages since they were causing actual linting issues to get lost in the noise by adding this to my settings:
			"python.analysis.disabled": [
				"unresolved-import"
			]
