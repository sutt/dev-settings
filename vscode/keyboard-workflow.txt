	Use Integrated Terminal:
	
	- helps when reading error msg from console into browsing your code
		
	-> need to completely replicate functionality of separate window consoles into vscode functionality:
		
		
		alt+q			focus into/out-of terminal
		ctrl+j			hide panel
		
		alt+L			switch editor vert/horiz layout
		ctrl+alt+L		switch panel  vert/horiz layout
		
		ctrl+alt+p		increase focused window size
		ctrl+alt+o		decrease focused window size
		
		
		in terminal editing		[if using regular windows cmd, not bash]
		
		
		esc				delete current line  
		
		ctrl+c			copy (on editing line or in terminal output)
		ctrl+v			paste (on editing line or in terminal output)
		
		ctrl+c+enter	send "ctrl+c" cmd to terminal process
		
		TODO
		scrolling+marking
		
		moving between consoles
		
		creating new consoles
		
		ctrl+shift+`	create new console
			how to create a new console at current cwd (like >start cmd)
		
		
	
	Examine Problems in workspace:
	
	- helps to do a high level validity check on solution
	
	
		ctrl+alt+m		view problems panel
		
		f8				cursor to next problem
		
		?				view the problem report for a highlighted region of code
		
		
		other workflow notes:
		
		- problem panel populates with open files in editors; close files to remove from panel
		
		- launch command palette (ctrl+shift+p) > Run Linting : executes lint on that file.
		
		- use workspace settings.json to comment/edit lines in python.linting.pylintArgs- list to suppress overwhelmingly common warnings
		
		todos:
		
		- how to mark problems specific lines of problems to ignore for the future; but still be able to examine them by reverting the ignore?
		

	Debugging:
	
		TODO: describe:
			launch.json
			args
			cwd
			stopOnEntry bug
			
			running a module for debug (python -m x.x)
				e.g. some indv tests in chess?
			
			how to set breakpoints before launch - HOWTO?
	
	
	Use a VSCode at half screen effectively 
	
	- helpful when you must interface with an outside terminal or second workspace
	
	- must be able to quickly change two editors + possible terminal + possible side-bar of a large workspace display
	
		HOWTO?
		- probably through mutli-cmd / macros extensions
		
		Best So Far:
		close panel + close sidebar - ctrl+j, ctrl+b (if nec.)
		editors on top of each		- alt+L (if nec.)
		maximize on editor			- alt+m 
		remove full-screen			- f11 (if nec.)
		snap to half-screen			- win+left
	
	
	Other panel operations
		
		ctrl+shift+m		view problems panel
		ctrl+shift+y		view debug console
		ctrl+shift+u		view output panel (e.g. python tools logging)
